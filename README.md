This repository conatins information about implementation of two delay based primitives TLP and VDF.

Performance measures to benchmark Time and Space Complexity is also included in the code.

To visualize the result we have added screenshots for results of TLP and VDF.


Dependencies: pycryptodome, python3, py-benchmark


To run the code: Download Zip, install the dependencies.

To Execute: python code_name.py (Eg: python TLP_code.py)
