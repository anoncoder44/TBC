Overview
This repository contains information about the implementation of two delay-based primitives:
1. Time-Lock Puzzle (TLP)
2. Verifiable Delay Function (VDF)

The repository also includes performance measures to benchmark time and space complexity for both primitives. Additionally, screenshots are provided to visualize the results of TLP and VDF implementations.
